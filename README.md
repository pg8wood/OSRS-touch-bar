# OSRS-touch-bar
OSRS-touch-bar displays [Old School RuneScape](http://oldschool.runescape.com) interface icons and maps them to the corresponding function keys in-game.

# Usage
On launch, your Touch Bar will display the interface shown above until you quit OSRS-touch-bar (even if you switch apps). 

Should you need the Control Strip or other "normal" Touch Bar functionality, simply click one of the buttons in the app and the Touch Bar will update accordingly.

## Privileges
OSRS-touch-bar will request assistive access on first launch. This is required for the scripts OSRS-touch-bar uses to temporarily toggle the Control Stip's visibility while you are using the app.
